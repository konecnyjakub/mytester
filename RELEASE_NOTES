A new version of My Tester is out. It removes stuff deprecated in 8.x series. Names of all interfaces were changed: they no longer start with I.

Argument --filterExceptFolders in mytester.php now applies also to .phpt files.

The script mytester.php now uses only 1 argument for changing code coverage/results formatter and setting custom file name.

For complete list of changes since previous version, see CHANGELOG.md.
