A new version of My Tester is out. It does some code cleaning/internal improvements at the cost of BC breaks. It is possible to use a different data provider or skip checker in TestCase as there are interfaces for them now. Extensions for automated tests runner can now add callbacks for starting and completing a test case. Results formatters are now responsible for outputting to file/console instead of just generating the output. It is now possible to use only arrays to set conditions for skipping a test when using the attribute (not passing any value is still allowed).

For complete list of changes since previous version, see CHANGELOG.md.
