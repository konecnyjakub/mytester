A new version of My Tester is out. It removes stuff deprecated in 8.x series. Names of all interfaces were changed: they no longer start with I.

Argument --filterExceptFolders in mytester.php now applies also to .phpt files.

The script mytester.php now uses only 1 argument for changing code coverage/results formatter and setting custom file name. It is also possible to use that argument multiple times to generate multiple reports at the same time.

For complete list of changes since previous version, see CHANGELOG.md.
