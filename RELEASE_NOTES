A new version of My Tester is out. It allows installation konecnyjakub/event-dispatcher 2.

This is probably the last version of 7.x series unless serious bugs are discovered (and fixed). These series will not receive any new features or improvements, development will be focused on version 8.0.

For complete list of changes since previous version, see CHANGELOG.md.
