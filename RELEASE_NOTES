A new version of My Tester is out. It is now possible to use different methods for running code before/after test case/method. The previously used methods will not be automatically called in the next major version unless they have the new corresponding attribute.

Job::$onAfterExecute is deprecated in favor of new event TestJobFinished, the former will be removed in the next major version.

For complete list of changes since previous version, see CHANGELOG.md.
