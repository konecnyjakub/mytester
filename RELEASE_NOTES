A new version of My Tester is out. It adds the option to output results of tests in a different format. Several options are already available, more might be added in the future.

It is now possible to change filename for output for some code coverage formats.

There are new assertions assertNoException and assertMatchesFile.

For complete list of changes since previous version, see CHANGELOG.md.
