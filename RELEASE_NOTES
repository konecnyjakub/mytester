A new version of My Tester is out, it is only for PHP 8.2 and later. There are a lot of internal changes/improvements (using new PHP features, reorganization of code), some of them allowed implementation of new features.

One of new features of the automated tests runner is the ability to report percentage of code coverage, future versions might expand code coverage functionality (e. g. generating a full report in Clover XML or HTML). The automated tests runner also now automatically removes .errors files previous runs and reports number of passed tests.

The option to mark tests in TestCase as supposed to fail was removed, the code was too complex and hard to maintain. On the other hand, TestCase now has a new assertion throwsException. There are also changes to result of test methods in TestCase: if the method has at least 1 parameter but its data provider provides none, it is now skipped and if it does not perform any assertions, it is marked as passed with warnings.

For complete list of changes since previous version, see CHANGELOG.md.
