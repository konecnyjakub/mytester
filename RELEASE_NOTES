A new version of My Tester is out. It adds assertions assertGreaterThan, assertLessThan and assertOutput. Tests can be marked as incomplete with method TestCase::markTestIncomplete().

Passing string to parameter $value of assertions assertCount and assertNotCount is now deprecated, it will not be possible in the next major version. It was never meant to possible to do that.

For complete list of changes since previous version, see CHANGELOG.md.
