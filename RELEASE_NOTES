A new version of My Tester is out. It does some code cleaning/internal improvements at the cost of BC breaks. It is possible to use a different data provider or skip checker in TestCase as there are interfaces for them now. Extensions for automated tests runner now define methods that are called when the corresponding event is triggered and can now react to events for starting and completing a test case. Results formatters are now responsible for outputting to file/console instead of just generating the output. It is now possible to use only arrays to set conditions for skipping a test when using the attribute (not passing any value is still allowed). Default skip checker can now skip tests based on OS family.

For complete list of changes since previous version, see CHANGELOG.md.
