A new version of My Tester is out. It is now possible to disable .phpt tests in mytester.php. Tests can be skipped if an env variable is not set (to a value) now. Test suites from certain subfolders can be excluded from loading and running.

For complete list of changes since previous version, see CHANGELOG.md.
