A new version of My Tester is out. Errors/exception thrown in a test method are reported as failure instead of crashing the script. It adds assertions assertArrayHasKey, assertArrayNotHasKey, assertSameSize and assertTriggersNoDeprecation. It is now possible to ignore deprecations in a test method. There are now dedicated attributes for skipping tests based on a condition, they should be used instead of attribute Skip.

For complete list of changes since previous version, see CHANGELOG.md.
