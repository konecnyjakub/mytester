A new version of My Tester is out. Deprecations triggered in a test method are now reported as warnings. It is possible to check that a deprecation was triggered in a test case (optionally with a specific message).

Method ConsoleColors::color can now also set background color.

For complete list of changes since previous version, see CHANGELOG.md.
